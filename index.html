                                    <p class="text-block__p">Jackson Wang was born on 28 March 1994. The rapper is an Aries and according to the Chinese zodiac, he was born in the Year of the Dog.
        
                                        In Chinese astrology, each year is related to a Chinese zodiac animal according to a 12-year cycle. The Dog comes after the Rooster and before the Pig, and occupies the 11th position in the Chinese zodiac. People belonging to this year are deemed loyal, honest, amiable, kind, cautious, and prudent.</p>

                                    <p class="text-block__p">One of the most interesting facts that a lot of people didn’t know about Wang is that he had turned down the opportunity to study at Stanford University, California. The rapper was offered a scholarship by the University for fencing but he chose to follow his heart, which led him to music.
        
                                        Wang had also turned down the 2012 London Olympics. Even though he grew up amongst world-class athletes — his father being a former Olympian (fencer) and mother a world champion gymnast, the rapper prioritised his passion.</p>
